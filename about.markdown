This site is meant to be more of a living notebook than a blog.

If you see "Updated: DATE," you're looking at a note. That page is meant to be alive in some sense, might be mostly empty, might be a dump of links, etc.

If you see "DATE (less of a note, more of a post)," well, as you might have guessed, you're looking at something more like a blog post. That doesn't really imply quality (sorry), but it should be more coherent than a note and it's not likely to change (the DATE is the "published" date, not a last-updated date).

Most of the content here should be notes. "Notes" are better for me, because the point is to learn, improve my thinking, and maintain some sort of writing practice (with this last point really being in service of the first two, i.e. writing is not an end in itself). "Posts" imply a degree of polish, perfectionism, and regularity that can be at odds with these three points.

That being said, I'll do my best to clean notes as I go and keep them somewhat legible to people who aren't me. There will be posts, as sometimes a project deserves a write-up and sometimes notes evolve into something more.

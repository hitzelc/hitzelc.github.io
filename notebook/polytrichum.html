    <i>Polytrichum</i> is a genus of moss. The scientific name is derived from the Ancient Greek polys and thrix - many and hair.
    <br><br>Where I currently live in Merrimack, NH, I see a little species called <i>Polytrichum commune</i> all over the place. This makes sense because it is, well, <i>common</i>.
    <br><br>I feel that I notice them more on slopes (mild slopes even, but rarely on a completely flat surface). I do not know if this is a pattern or if I am just imagining things, I will look into it.
    <br><br>It seems hard to find near me since about late April/early May, seems to have disappeared for the summer? Is this common? Or is it the rainfall? As far as I am aware, we're experiencing a drought right now (June 4th 2020).
    <br><br>7 June 2020: I hiked <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/new-hampshire/mount-tecumseh-trail">Mt. Tecumseh</a> and wouldn't you know it: <i>Polytrichum commune</i> (and possibly <i>Polytricum juniperinum</i>).
    <br>A number of variables here if we are comparing to the backyard:
    <ul>
    <li>Lower temperatures</li>
    <li>Greater inclines</li>
    <li>Less sunlight</li>
    <li>More moisture</li>
    </ul>
    and of course there are the interactions between these things. The moss seemed to get more deeply green as I ascended.
    <br><br>12 June 2020: I went for a walk along a power line trail behind the community I currently live in. Moss was waiting to be found.

    <br>Again, the moss was most abundant in well shaded areas, under cover of young trees or behind stones. Slopes seem to be a must, though I did note a few patches in a dry, flat, well-sunned area between some sloping trails. The moss in this area was small and seemingly young, surrounded by what must have been dead relatives.

    <br><br>The vascular function in <i>Polytrichum commune</i> has shown similarity to that of "higher plants" (e.g. trees?)

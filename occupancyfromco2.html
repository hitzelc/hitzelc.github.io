<head><title>(DRAFT) An Idea for Estimating Occupancy Using CO2 Reading</title></head>
<body>
	<p>Suppose you want to know the occupancy on a given floor of a commercial building. You have no way of counting occupants directly, but you do have access to CO2 sensor readings. Specifically, you have a CO2 reading for both the return and supply air for the floor.</p>
	<p>Air of a certain CO2 concentration enters the floor in one location and air of another CO2 concentration exits the floor at another location. The difference in CO2 readings between supply and return should primarily be a function of the number of people on the floor, plus or minus ventilation. To simplify, let's assume ventilation takes place within the air system only and never on the floor itself (i.e. there are no open windows).</p>
	<p>We have an input CO2, an output CO2, and what seems to be a black-box between the two. There are some things we know though: the total square footage of the floor, the approximate height of the ceiling, and the fact that CO2 is going to diffuse from one end of the room to the other given some amount of time.</p>
	<p>How then to turn this into an estimate of occupancy? Let us assume that an unknown number of people are uniformly distributed across the floor (i.e. let us impose a grid on the floor and assume each grid cell is equally likely to hold one person). Then the question of how many people are on the floor can be phrased as follows: given the change in CO2 readings, what floor configuration is most likely?</p>

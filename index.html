<p style="text-align:center;">Hello, </p>
<p style="text-align:center;">We are Chris and Sean of smallfarms.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">We believe that localized production and short supply chains lead to greater community autonomy, smaller environmental footprints, and healthier living (both physically and spiritually).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">We want to supply high quality, sustainable food products to local restuarants, bars, and cafes for reasonable prices.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">We want people to fall back in love with the land around them. Our long term goals are big, but we're only getting started and we'll need help to become helpful ourselves!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">As would-be farmers, step one for us is going to be figuring out what to grow, what local needs are, and what reasonable prices might be.</p>
    
<p style="text-align:center;">If you have something you're in need of, if you have something you're dying to source locally but can't manage to find yet, or if you just want to help us out, please consider filling out (some) of the form at the link below:</p>

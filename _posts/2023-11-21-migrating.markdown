![migrating](/images/migrating.jpg)

I've moved on from a messy from-the-hip HTML site to using a static site generator (Jekyll).

I migrated the older content because I don't want to throw it away.

The old approach had a lot of blank canvas-style freedom, but that introduced some overhead and organizational/creative frictions that seemed counter to my main goal of maintaining a writing habit as a tool for thinking and learning.

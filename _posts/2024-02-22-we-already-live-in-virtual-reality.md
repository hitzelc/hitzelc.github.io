Recently on Twitter there's been some discourse around whether or not it is fair that candidates for software engineering and developer positions are often expected to have a (public) portfolio of some kind showing their work. The yes-it's-fair case mostly seems to be that passionate employees perform better and no one becomes the best at a game without a great love for the game. The no-it's-not case mostly seems to be that other professions don't have similar requirements and that a job is not your life so who cares what you do outside of work hours.

I'll take a position quickly to get it out of the way so we can move on to the meat of the post: I agree with the yes-it's-fair folks. It's obviously true that people who enjoy something will become better at it, all else being equal, than those who do not enjoy something. It's also obviously true that people who spend more time on something will become better at it, all else being equal, than people who spend less time at it. For this reason, it's logical that employers would seek passioante individuals who can point to projects they've done. If that feels like another hoop to jump through, well, there you go: you view it as something you have to check off -- someone who is just having a good time would do these projects whether they wanted the job or not.

I'd also add that there are probably positive externalities to society to having better, more passionate software engineers. The current state of software doesn't really scream "craftmanship" so we could do worse than looking for people with a twinkle in their eye.

I'm sympathetic to the stance that a job is a job, and job's are necessary, and you are under no obligation to love your job. That's very true. However, the majority of people in and around and trying to break into the so-called tech industry in the United States are generally the sort of people who have an abundance of choice as to what career path they want for themselves. For that reason, I'm not very sympathetic to their complaints, and they almost make me a little mad, because I think people with the opportunity to pursue a path they enjoy do have an obligation to pursue that path (or at least an obligation NOT to whine when they don't pursue it).

Okay, the no-it's-not case isn't particularly defensible -- but is it understandable? Definitely! Tech has money, and money is desirable, not only because it's money but also because it's cool. For that reason, being a software engineer or developer has become something of a high status career in the eyes of many. When something is known as a high status career for a long enough time, it becomes a default career path[^1].

Here are some other default career paths:
* Doctor
* Lawyer
* Investment banker
* Management consultant

Some ways to think about default career paths are:
* What did most of my least creative peers want to be when we were younger?
* When I close my eyes and imagine an Ivy grad, what are they doing for work?

Of course we can also look at what Ivy league students do. If you look ([Google "[school] majors" and look at the IPEDS data that results](https://www.google.com/search?q=harvard+majors){:target="_blank"}) at the top majors at the Ivies, you'll see the following:
* Harvard: (1) social sciences, (2) economics (3) CS
* Yale: (1) economics, (2) political science (3) CS
* Princeton: (1) CS, (2) economics (3) public policy
* Brown: (1) CS, (2) economics (3) applied math
* Columbia: (1) CS, (2) economics (3) political science
* Cornell: (1) CS, (2) biology (3) labor and industrial relations??
* Dartmouth: (1) economics, (2) political science (3) CS
* Penn: (1) finance, (2) economics (3) nursing?? but don't worry...(4) CS

Lots of lawyer-feeding and finance-feeding majors, a heap of desire to work in politics, a sprinkle of medical knowhow, and plenty of...computer science.

Clearly, the elites are interested. America's priests dream of working at Google. What about our warriors (or are they merchants --  your call!)?

Well, let's start with MIT. Many a young dork drools over MIT, so let's hope they can be a decent bellwether for America's scientific and engineering talent.

A good 40% of students major in some kind of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, and a smattering more major in some vaguely computer adjacent fields[^2]. Ostensibly some of them want to be electrical engineers ([VI-1](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/curriculum/6-1-electrical-science-and-engineering/){:target="_blank"} "focuses on the study of circuits and devices, materials and nanotechnology, communications, control and signal processing, applied physics, and biological applications"), but I think it is fair to say the vast majority are "software-biased."

In fact, over the past 7 years more and more MIT students have been majoring in EECS. Mathematics has also been climbing. Mathematics is great! But I think mathematics is riding on EECS coattails a bit, as there is a "mathematics with computer science" option available. It's also possible that a math major (specifically/usually an applied math major) is one of the easier double majors to add. At many schools, there's a good amount of overlap in coursework.

Physics: down, mechanical engineering: down, materials science, aeroastro, bioengineering: down down down! Business: up and to the right! You know it! We're rich, baby!!! It looks like the students are angling for roles in tech and finance...are they?

![careertable](/images/careertable.png)

Yep! Half of undergrads in 2023 went into "Information/Computer Technology" or "Finance and Insurance."[^3] And given it's not clear whether a developer employed in "Finance and Insurance" or "Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services" is still counted in that industry, the amount of undergrads working as developers might be higher than the 32% shown.

And it isn't just MIT, here's some of that Googled IPEDS data for tech schools that came to mind (not being particularly scientific here, sorry):
* Harvey Mudd: 22.9% "mathematics and computer science"
* CalTech: 35.3% "computer science"
* Georgia Tech: 21.3% "computer and information sciences"

Blah blah blah -- what's the point again?

The point is that the no-it's-not case is understandable. Not only is it understandable, it's inevitable. There is no way such a large portion of America's technically talented youth can be genuinely excited about software development. There is a way such a large portion of America's technically talent youth can be genuinely excited about money, about startups, about cushy big tech jobs, and so on.

These people do not want to express their deepest selves through the medium of code. These people want to drill some leetcode, learn the interview dance moves, and "crack the case." Tech is the new management consulting, the new ibanking, the new whatever. Go visit Wall Street Oasis or /r/consulting and look at the aspirants -- the psychological profile you intuit is the MAJORITY of what is entering tech. The joyous computer nerd is the MINORITY. Do not forget it!

If every elite and would-be-engineer in America is dying to write some JavaScript, or maybe manage someone who writes some JavaScript, or better yet deliver a company that provides JavaScript, we get the world we have right now. And we're going to keep getting the bloated web and the disenchanted moaning and so on until that stops, because the majority of these people don't like what they're doing.

Software sucks up so much talent and attention that talented people are mostly focused on building virtual reality, even though most of them hate it, and so the rest of us live in a virtual reality that sucks. Software ate the world and shat it back out.

Now that layoffs abound and language models can crap out semi-literate code (and even if you are skeptical there you must admit it's good enough to churn out bloated, boilerplate CRUD logic), maybe there'll be some pressure driving people away from this. Capital has wised up, and cultural propaganda like "the Gundo" and "American Dynamism" is attempting to make the real world attractive and cool again. That's all well and good, and I hope it succeeds. I think for the kind of people who are in the position to be passionate about their career and choose to pursue it rather than complain, these efforts will be effective. But to the extent we need more bodies than the pool of true believers provides, I think money is going to do the rest of the work. It's going to have to pay **not** to write software.

If you are looking to get started in deep tech, to try your hand at hard tech, I recommend trying to fix your toilet or air conditioner first. See how that goes!
